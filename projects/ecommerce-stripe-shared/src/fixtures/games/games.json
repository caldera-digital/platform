    "description": "Four-player action fighter, starring 12 Nintendo mascots, including Mario, Luigi, Fox, Link, Samus, Pikachu, Jigglypuff and Captain Falcon. All the action takes place on one screen, from a zoomed out third-person perspective more reminiscent of old-school platformers than traditional fighting games. The premise is as simple as the controls. Beat up you opponents and knock them off the fighting platform to score a point. The more damage your opponents sustain, the farther you can throw them. Apart from the quick, but explosive mayhem that ensues when more than one player has at it, the game manages to bring back many fond gaming memories by bombarding players with familiar items, power-ups and many classic tunes.",

    "description": "While it's officially a sequel to the immensely popular Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross is completely its own role-playing game with over 40 characters, a branching story line, and multiple endings. Like its predecessor, the game is about crossing through time and setting things right. This story focuses on Serge's quest for the Frozen Flame, which will give the beholder the power to bend space and time. Serge wants the power to save himself from dying in a parallel universe but, as you can guess, nefarious forces are also vying for the Frozen Flame to suit their own purposes.\nChrono Cross features the stylish character designs and wondrous cut scenes that gamers have come to expect from SquareSoft, but the game also has a number of gameplay innovations. Though the battle engine is essentially turn-based, characters don't have to wait their turn to cast a spell or make an attack; battles are moderated by stamina. Also, the repetitive battles with lesser monsters that make so many RPGs sag can be easily avoided because all monsters can be seen on the screen.",

    "description": "SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of their Final Fantasy titles, and Final Fantasy VIII should be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary. Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.\nThe game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue, Final Fantasy VIII has it all. However, Final Fantasy VIII falls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.",

    "description": "Resident Evil 2 is the first really big, ultrahyped blockbuster of '98, and what Capcom has pulled off is more an interactive, cinematic experience than a video game. Seriously. Picking up a few months after the events of the first game, RE2 sees the entire town of Raccoon City hit with the devastating virus that zombified only a few dozen folks in the original Resident Evil. It's up to rookie cop Leon Kennedy, and Claire Redfield, sister of one of the main RE characters, to save not only themselves but any and all survivors, to boot. The gameplay remains basically the same as before: As one of two characters, you solve puzzles and shoot monsters. The original Resident Evil featured two playable personas as well, although the differences between the two weren't incredibly significant. One could carry more items than the other could, while the other was easier to play, and they both had their own distinct storylines. In Resident Evil 2 the differences between the two are a bit more interesting. For example, Claire starts off with a lock pick, while Leon begins with a lighter, which alone changes the order in which the game's puzzles must be solved. Each character also finds different weapons along his or her quest. For instance, Claire will find a grenade launcher, however when playing as Leon, a shotgun will be in its place.",

    "description": "Bomberman is easily the most prolific character in video game history, having appeared in titles for every major system since the original NES - and with multiple versions on quite a few. And yet with so many installations, every game until now (with the dubious exception of Panic Bomber on the Virtual Boy) has maintained the same premise: The player plays as a little robot who tries to be the bomb he throws. The robot character drops bombs to clear his way through the playing field's blockades and obstacles, attempting to blow up his enemies all the while. But if he doesn't run like hell to get away from the blast, he'll go up in smoke as well. Besides obviously clearing pathways, the advantage to blowing up obstacles is that power-up items appear from within the wreckage that either help or hinder him. These power-ups include the kick boot (to propel the bomb forward), the glove (to chuck the bombs airborne), fire (to expand their blast radius), extra bombs (the more the merrier), or the dreaded skull icon, which grants the formidable Bomberhea (which is kind of like red kryptonite to Superman, giving a different disruptive effect with each exposure).",

Nearly three years after the uncloaking of super spy action-adventure GoldenEye 007, developer extraordinaire Rare introduces futuristic special operative Joanna Dark, a.k.a. Perfect. In Perfect Dark, players are sent on a fast-paced adventure from downtown Chicago skyscrapers to underground labs to undersea wrecks of otherworldly origins. Naturally, the storyline weaves a complex web of conspiracy, hidden agendas, and megalomaniac corporate leaders with deep underground (and off-world) ties. As spy-game fans expect, unraveling the plot and disposing of the baddies require a grab bag of hi-tech gadgets and special weapons--especially given the game's tougher and smarter enemies.\nPerfect Dark features Dolby surround sound, widescreen compatibility, and--as expected--stunning special effects, including dynamic lighting, chest-thumping explosions and realistic smoke, dust and steam clouds. Characters are lifelike thanks to motion-captured animations and beautifully rendered 3-D models.",

Along with a horde of mini-sized clowns, he presents eight interactive battlegrounds on which to do combat, including his bedroom, the carnival, and eight hidden levels.\nThese new environments have more traps and gizmos than previous Twisted Metal games, including randomly deposited gas barrels, secret areas, and new weapons in larger quantities. The game also introduces the ability to drive on walls and make giant leaps from building to building. Players can choose from 20 new characters and deathmobiles, including a demented family with a fierce station wagon or rock star Rob Zombie's Dragula mobile. Also new to this edition of the car-combat freak show is the \"create a car\" option, which allows you to customize a car's size, color, model, and special weapon. The rock and rap soundtrack for this combat chaos is provided by Rob Zombie, Cypress Hill, Cirrus, Ghoulspoon, One Minute Silence, and Skold.

Trying to get as much done before restarting is awesome. Then getting to transform into a Deku, Zora, and Goron puts this game over the top. You also get to fight the bosses (although there are only four big bosses) as many times as you like. Every time you restart the three days, you get to fight them again by warping straight to their lair. Fighting Goht is one of those experiences that's worth reliving again and again! --Nightmare",

Both Spyro fans and those who didn't play the first game will revel in the exploratory greatness that is Spyro: Ripto's Rage. Gone are the impossible tasks, unbeatable enemies, and fragmented game flow. This game sports superior controls, more colorful and faster graphics, a tighter story, achievable goals, and plenty of gameplay variety.\nDon't be fooled by Spyro's cuteness--this isn't a kid's-only game. With multiple goals and side quests, a fantastic soundtrack by ex-Police band member Stewart Copeland, and a veneer of understated humor, Spyro: Ripto's Rage is highly addictive. The playfulness of the main character comes through in the exploration of the otherworldly levels using the new moves, including super high jumps, rapid underwater swimming, and extended flight and hovering maneuvers.",

Although the Burnout series’ over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console, Burnout Paradise is the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will.

And that arcade experience was what many gamers wanted at home back in the day.\n\nWas the Atari home version of Frogger perfect? No, but then few Atari 2600 games ever were, mainly because of generally sub-par graphics. But one has to keep in mind the technology level of the time, and the Atari had a lot going for it in terms of the number of games available for it and often in gameplay. --Ty Johnston",

Combine the game's quality with the fact that it was added to the PlayStation's bargain Greatest Hits collection, and you have a title that deserves to be in the library of any racing fan.\nHot Pursuit gets its name from our favorite mode of gameplay, in which players try to exceed the reach of the long arm of the law by greatly exceeding the speed limit. The ultimate goal is to beat your opponent to the finish line, but usually it's hard enough just dodging oncoming traffic, swerving around police roadblocks (complete with spike strips), and trying to keep pursuit vehicles from slamming you off the road. It's nearly as fun to watch replays as it is to race, and we've only discussed one of the game's five types of play. This diverse, fast-paced racer is definitely a keeper. --T. Byrl Baker",

If you can get this game, I would. It is a gem indeed. Panzer Dragoon Zewi was the prequel I believe, but came out after the original. That game is a gem also. And I think everyone knows how good of an RPG Panzer Dragoon Saga was, so no need to give the breakdown on that. If I had any negatives on Panzer Dragoon (and Panzer Dragoon Zewi) was only the few hours of gameplay.

Pocket Monsters Red was released in Japan in 1996 by mail-order only (the two launch titles were Green and Blue). The franchise arrived in the west in 1998 as Pokemon Blue and Red (Roald Dahl holds the copyright for \"Pocket Monsters\" in the west, so the title was changed to the Japanese colloquial name).

You'll need all the control you can get, too, as you roar through the twists and turns of F-Zero's 15 deviously difficult courses. There are four hover cars to choose from, each with its own strong points and weak points. Most beginners find the durability and handling of the Fire Stingray easiest to use (despite poor acceleration), but veteran players will often choose the more-balanced Blue Falcon.\nStrategy plays a big part in this speedfest. In this one-player racing game you will need to find shortcuts, elude hazards and snag power-ups if you want to beat your savvy competition. Keep an eye out for sand, land mines, magnets and other trouble spots, but always be ready to get a boost from a speed or jump plate. You'll earn one Super Turbo per lap, and part of the strategy is knowing when to use it.",

    "description": "GoldenEye 007 has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans of Doom and Quake will recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows the film closely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.\nControls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.",

    "description": "Featuring a new adventure that's filled with numerous enhancements and innovations, this long-awaited sequel to Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow greatly improves upon the series' winning formula, and makes for an even more insanely addictive and wholly absorbing gaming experience.\nLike Pokémon Gold--which essentially is the same story, with minor gameplay variations--Pokémon Silver casts players in the familiar role of a young Pokémon Trainer who's out to collect as many different kinds of Pokémon as possible. As in previous games, gameplay consists mostly of exploration (completing various quests in the process) and Pokémon battles, which employ a unique battle system that's like a complex twist on rock-paper-scissors.\n\nBut, despite the similarities, it's quite apparent that Pokémon Silver is a whole new ball game from the start. The game is played out in real time, with the current time and day of the week (recorded by an internal clock) having a direct impact on gameplay elements, such as what Pokémon you'll find in the wild, and when certain events occur and characters appear.",

    "description": "This is the original SNES Star Fox game, which puts you as Fox McCloud in an epic, space opera rail-shooter adventure. The game was notable for including the Super FX chip, which gave programmers the ability to create 3D objects with simple polygons.\n\nI booted up this game today, and it's still a blast to run through. Yes, it's very primitive 3D - you can count the individual polygons on each object - but the designs are creative and Nintendo found some commendable ways to make distinct, varied worlds with what they had. It always marvels to see the programming feats and innovations of the 16-bit era, and Star Fox is the pinnacle of that.\n\nMore importantly, the game plays well. A couple of the later FX Chip games suffered by pushing 3D at the cost of gameplay. The framerate in Star Fox does suffer a bit in the later levels when there's so much onscreen, but overall the game plays exactly like a fast-paced shooter should. You get your upgrades, barrel rolls, adjustable settings, multiple difficulty levels, and a few secrets to discover - not bad for a game that could've just cashed in based on its graphics. --Simon",

    "description": "There are certain games that I have come across since my inception into the video game world (with the Christmas gift of an NES console and Super Mario Bros./Duck Hunt in 1988) that seem to surpass the simple moniker of \"video game.\" These are beautifully crafted pieces of art that reach a level of perfection rarely seen in any medium. Still, the most important element of such games is that they are FUN. Graphics, yeah, sound, blahblahblah, etc., but does the game make you feel that you haven't wasted those precious hours of your life? Gunstar Heroes is such a game that the answer is most certainly \"yes.\" Upon the first few moments of play, you may think that it is too simplistic (the game is equipped with automatic-fire for every weapon), or just Sega's attempt at cashing in on Contra (though no one did so more disgracefully than Konami themselves). --Jace A.

    "description": "While it won't win many points for originality, Luigi's Mansion is great fun to play, and it's a perfect showcase for the GameCube's graphics horsepower. In the game, Luigi--Mario's younger brother and costar of several games through the years--has inherited a spooky old mansion provided he can summon the courage to spend the night within its haunted walls. Luigi arrives prepared to clean house using a Ghostbusters-like device that stuns the ghosts with light and then vacuums them up safely. The gameplay gets tricky when some of the bigger light-shy ghosts vanish before you can put the Hoover on them. And, should one of the spectral pests sneak up on Luigi, he loses courage and the common currency of all Mario-inspired games: gold coins. Graphically, the game is amazing for its translucent ghosts, mirrored images, and particle effects (Luigi's vacuum device will also suck the dust off a chair and the mist out of a freezer). The game's campy visuals are more cute than spooky, so even jittery Mario fans will love this one. --Porter B. Hall",

Later on these pads are used to activate a slingshot and throwing knives; to turn Conker into an anvil and drop downward; to shoot automatic, double-handed guns; to activate a The Matrix-inspired slow-motion effect and flip through the air shooting enemies; and much, much more.",

Led by four wraith commanders, this ravenous band of phantoms is the ultimate predator and has been for centuries. Its quarry: humans. The witcher must bring all his abilities to bear in confronting this ancient force, these ghastly spectral riders who for ages have brought misery to the world. For this time the Hunt seeks just one person: the one individual Destiny itself entrusted to Geralt. The one soul Geralt considers kin. The grand finale to the legend of Geralt of Rivia. In the past he has raised and overthrown monarchs, battled legendary monsters and saved the lives of many. Now Geralt embarks on his most personal quest to save his loved ones and protect the world from an ancient threat. The story is drawn based on player decisions. Each action will have consequences which change the story and the game world. NPCs, communities, monsters and locations all change, based on player choice. The player can resolve quests and main story threads in any order or compete them in a parallel fashion. The combination of an intriguing story with a free roaming gameplay style allows the players to craft the story to suit individual preferences. The Witcher 3 is standalone adventure, easily entered into by new players - the story and game world do not require the player to know the previous games or even the books.",

( and still do ) Back in the hay day of 2D games Sonic R was the first full 3D sonic game on the Sega Saturn, there was the hub world in Sonic Jam but that was only a part of the game. In general, I love racing games and Sonic R is not a normal racing game at all! It was brought to us by Yuji Naka and the Sega Team in 1997 and I still find it to be a great game even today. I remember buying it in 1998 two or three months before the demise of the Sega Saturn. ( a tear drops from my eye! ) The powers that be and the Nintendo Fan Boys pretty much poo-pooed it because they were comparing it to Mario Kart, ( an awesome game ) but it's not the same type of game. In Sonic R the emphasis is on jumping, exploring, collecting rings, the multiple tracks and finding all the hidden areas the game has to offer. The worlds are similar in looks to early Sonic games and that's always a good thing for us Sonic lovers. The game moves along at a fast 30 fps, and the worlds are well drawn and colorful. The music is so happy and bouncy it can be a bit overwhelming at times, but it is well written and it fits the overall feel to the game. --Mark B Allred",

Guide the legendary plumber through an incredibly vast magical world with never-before-seen movement and camera-angle freedom. Mario's got the moves with graduated speeds of running and walking, jumps, super jumps, bounce attacks, swimming, and more. The more you play, the more moves you'll discover.\nThis industry milestone game lets gamers play at their own pace, encouraging them to explore new nooks and crannies of its many levels with a Zen-like approach where the journey is as important as the goal. Other N64 games such as Zelda, Banjo-Kazooie, and Donkey Kong 64 all owe much of their inspiration to this gem of a game. A showcase for the system's graphics and processing speed capabilities, Super Mario 64 is a must-have for any N64 owner. --Jeff Young",

Anti-U.S. resentment comes to a head under the leadership of guerrilla militia leader Suhadi Sadono, acting with the unofficial support of major corrupt factions of the Indonesian government. Suhadi's men attack and occupy the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, taking dozens of civilian and military personnel hostage.\nDeployed by a top secret wing of the NSA (National Security Agency) known as Third Echelon, Sam Fisher is a lone field operative supported by a remote team. Fisher must defend and assist the U.S. military, both locally and from remote locations, until Suhadi's terror-driven policies can be subverted and the guerrilla faction eradicated.

Crash Team Racing does an excellent job of re-creating that same thrill on the PlayStation.\nCrash Team Racing has all the marks of the kart-racing genre, including big-headed characters driving diminutive go-karts, power-ups to increase speed and slow down opponents, and thematic tracks with multiple paths for exploration. What CTR adds to the mix is fairness: tighter-turning cars are rewarded for precision driving, skillful jumping, and strategic placement of booby traps. Sure, the playing field is level, but the better the driver, the better chance he or she has of winning consistently without any annoying \"catch-up code.\"\n\nThe one-player game is wonderfully presented as an exploratory adventure, while the multiplayer mode is a split-screen must-play for anyone with a PlayStation (and, of course, friends). Twenty-five tracks, 12 characters, and responsive control make CTR the gotta-have racing game. --Jeff Young",

    "description": "Although it's geared more for younger players, Pokémon Snap is good clean fun for Pokémon fans of any age. In this Pokémon battle-free adventure, players assist Professor Oak in completing his Pokémon Report by photographing the cute little buggers in the wild on Pokémon Island. Players take a trolley-like ride through the island's 3-D environments, filled with Pokémon that not only look just like they do in the cartoons, but also have \"cries\" to match. While there's a limited amount of film for each trip and no zoom lens, players enjoy great freedom of directional movement from within the vehicle, thanks to solid controls.\nPokémon Snap isn't as easy as it looks, as not just any old picture will satisfy Professor Oak; submissions for his Pokémon Report are judged on size, pose, technique, and whether or not there's more than one of the same Pokémon in the picture. As progress is made, new areas open up, and players are given items to aid them in their quest. Although there are only seven areas, they need to be revisited often, as hidden and otherwise uncooperative Pokémon must be \"coaxed\" by using items that you previously didn't have before. Also, Pokémon will do some of the craziest things--which make for great photographs--but only under certain conditions that require much experimentation (or a strategy guide) to unearth. --Joe Hon",

The entire series is one of the best ever made (I find it necessary to mention, or course, that Phantasy Star III is not very good, as it was made by a different company). I would really like to see a new one for one of the next generation systems (Phantasy Star Online doesn't really count).\nPhantasy Star IV is a classic. It has the standard combat system, with you and the enemies on opposite sides, with attacks, special skills, and techniques which you can perform. It is still a lot of fun, though. It has a high level of random encounters, but it is necessary to fight a lot, and do a lot of leveling-up, to be powerful enough to fight the bosses. --nafysmiley",

Features include a cast of 11 fighters, each with a diverse style and interisting costumes, a decent amount of options including 2 variations of the game(2&2.1)some great backgrounds(the Dural Stage Rules) and argueably the best graphix of a 3-D fighter for the Saturn. Some of the downsides: the infamous floaty jump that allows your character to jump 3x it's hight and fly clear across the arena, the camera during the win poses sometimes gets stuck inside the character, then theres the missing pixels that plague every attempt Saturn has made in the 3-D world. When I first got this game I'd have given it a 5 but after playing Fighting Vipers and Fighters Megamix this game just started to collect some dust. In all a great game, but Fighters Megamix blows it out of the water. --Eric A. Kisner",

    "description": "After several years in video game retirement, Sonic the Hedgehog returns as the star of a graphically stunning 3-D adventure game that blows away every other game in the genre. Sonic is joined by five of his friends in a massive quest that spans over 50 game levels filled with remarkable visuals and a pulsating soundtrack. Taking full advantage of the unprecedented processing power of the Dreamcast, Sega's development crew, Sonic Team, has designed several gravity-defying game levels that will keep gamers hooked.\nOur favorite level is Windy Valley, which requires you to survive the stormy perils of a tremendous tornado. This tyrant of nature chases you relentlessly before ultimately sucking you into the air and up through its eye. During the chase, the tornado manages to tear up just about everything on the screen. This dizzying visual spectacle moves so fast that you will literally hold on to the game controller for dear life.",

In this massive and graphically beautiful game, Donkey Kong and his pals must right the wrongs of King K. Rool by exploring their home island in search of more than 200 gold bananas, as well as other items that help the primates' progress.\n\nPlayers alternate control of Donkey Kong and four other characters--each with unique abilities--to complete puzzles, conquer \"baddies,\" compete in mini-games, and navigate through physical challenges. In addition to the single-player adventure, unique multiplayer games offer opportunities for social interaction between marathon solo sessions.",

But don't brush off this 3-D action-adventure as an uninspired clone. On the contrary, Banjo-Kazooie introduces more than enough originality to warrant a spot next to its famous mentor.\nThe game introduces two of the most charming virtual heroes in recent years--the goofy, floppy honey bear, Banjo, and his faithful, feathered sidekick Kazooie. In the game's introduction, we discover that the sinister witch Gruntilda not only nabbed Banjo's sister Tooty, but stole her beauty as well. Naturally, it's up to the bear-bird team to retrieve Tooty and rid the world of one darned inconsiderate witch.\n\nIn this beautifully-rendered and massive game world, players run, jump, swim, climb, and flip over obstacles, defeat all sorts of \"baddies,\" and find and collect numerous items and clues that help the quest to progress. Playing as both Banjo and Kazooie, players hone their characters' actions, learning nearly two dozen special moves that help players expertly defeat foes and successfully tread through the nine worlds.",

In this one, you can choose to be either John Morris or Eric Lecarde, which allows a different change of pace of having just one character to start off with (faintly similar like Castlevania III for the NES, except in that game you start with just one). The graphics are essentially good for the Genesis, so I have no complaints (YES, they're better than the NES). --Axel Law",

    "description": "Thanks to glowing reviews and a fan base of rabid racing purists, Gran Turismo has built up a reputation as the definitive driving simulation for the PlayStation. While that proved good news for Sony's coffers, it posed a tough challenge for its developers: How can the sequel surpass the original? For better or worse, Gran Turismo 2 has taken the Star Wars: Special Edition approach to tackling this challenge. The bulk of the game's top-notch graphics and gameplay remain true to the original, but this version is packed with extra add-ons - more tracks, more cars, more races and more secrets - that have turned the game into a mammoth two-disc experience. The sequel may not play or look noticeably better than the original, but it's certainly a bigger meal to digest. With that said, prospective buyers will fall into four categories: * Fans who loved the original Gran Turismo and have actually unlocked all the game's secrets: The purchase of this game is a no-brainer. * Fans who loved the original Gran Turismo but lacked the patience or skills to unlock all the game's secrets: The addition of an off-road rally racing mode won't be enough incentive to rehash a gameplay formula all too similar to the original, despite having more cars and tracks. This might not be your cup of tea. * Those who haven't played Gran Turismo but who love cars and seek a pure racing simulation: The purchase of this game is also a no-brainer, assuming you have a lot of free time ahead. * Casual video gamers looking for fun, easy racing entertainment (or for those shopping for a kids' gift): It's a toss-up. The skill needed to master the nuances of this game, as well as its depth, might prove too much for those looking for a less sophisticated, less demanding racer.",

Like any decent Mudokon, Abe aims to rescue his peers. He also is determined to seek justice in his battle to bring down the corrupt Rupture Farms. You help Abe carry out his heroic duties by possessing enemies, participating in action sequences worthy of an Indiana Jones flick, and talking to fellow Mudokons using the game's impressive \"gamespeak\" feature, which allows multiple characters to communicate with each other using your control pad.\nThe graphics in Abe's Oddyssee convey a unique personality, which is often lacking in platform action games. Still, a few pretty game environments will not distract you from the devious puzzles scattered throughout the game. Fortunately, you never run out of lives in Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. Instead, Abe rematerializes immediately after you \"die\" and the game continues from the last checkpoint you reached. This approach encourages exploration, which you'll want to do anyway since this is one of the most beautiful 2-D games we've seen. --T. Byrl Baker",

While not the first game to offer enhanced control with Sony's dual-stick analog controller, Ape Escape is the first game to require either an analog or dual shock controller to play. That requirement ensures that players will have full control of their hero, Spike. One stick moves Spike in any direction, while the other swings his monkey-catching devices.\nIn Ape Escape, a circus monkey named Specter stumbles upon a scientist's prototype intelligence-enhancing helmet, turning him into an evil monkey genius. As Spike, the professor's young friend, you must travel through time to clean up all of the monkeys Specter has sent back in his attempt to repopulate the world. If that's not enough to make you laugh, then chasing his goofy monkey minions as they scurry from your clutches will certainly tickle your funny bone. You'll discover a variety of gadgets to help you in your quest, including monkey radar, a slingshot, and a propeller for flying. Spanning 25 huge levels, Ape Escape is approachable for novices, and offers added challenges for veteran gamers. One such challenge is to lure a dinosaur near a rocky cliff, and then jar the monkey off his back and into your net. Note: no monkeys were harmed in the creation of this game. --Jeff Young",

Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal returns gamers to Planet Veldin, the setting of the original Ratchet & Clank, where the duo set off on a gripping new adventure through a multitude of diverse planets to fight for galactic peace. Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.\nAfter word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest in Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.",

    "description": "Syphon Filter's balance of an intriguing storyline and thrilling mission-based gameplay rightfully earned the game lots of critical acclaim and a position on the 1999 bestsellers chart. Syphon Filter 2 introduces a new set of objectives requiring smarts, stealth, and a steady aim while running (and kneeling, crouching, walking, rolling, climbing, jumping) through multiple levels.\nIn the game, players assume the roles of secret agents Gabriel Logan and Lian Xing. Framed for a crime they did not commit, the two must race against the clock in order to prevent the sale of the Syphon Filter virus to a terrorist nation. Played from a third-person point of view, the story takes gamers from the streets of Moscow to the Agency's secret Syphon Filter lab. Such a dangerous mission requires effective weapons and gadgets; naturally, the agency provides an arsenal of more than 25 enemy-stoppers, including a cross bow, a sniper rifle with a night-vision scope, tear gas, binoculars, and other goodies. New to the series is a two-player, split-screen mode featuring fast head-to-head combat action in 20 arenas. --Eric Twelker\n\n",

You explore a vast island named Koholint, opening up access to more new and new areas as you collect special items and solve puzzles. On your way, you gather Rupees and heart containers, use your sword to defeat enemies, and push plenty of blocks around.",

Count Dracula has once again weakened the seals of his tomb, and the Belmont family is getting anxious.\nIn the latest crusade against the forces of evil, players can choose between two brave vampire-slaying characters. Young Reinhardt Schneider, like his predecessors in the celebrated vampire-hunting Belmont family, will rely primarily on his whip. The other character is Carrie Fernandez, a young woman skilled in the ways of magic and spell-casting. Both are on the hunt for the dreaded Dracula and his devoted legions of vampires. You play a game all the way through with the character you've chosen, concluding with his or her own ending. Each character has an individual route to travel, and to see all of the areas you will have to complete the game using both characters.\n\nThe passage of time and, especially, the fall of night, play a prominent role in the game. Players will have to search castles filled with dark corners, winding staircases, and other gloomy places. Daytime is the right time for exploring, but be on the lookout for vampires lurking in the shadows.",

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popular Zelda series will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.\nThe game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.",

What was revolutionary at the time was you used a Zapper to do it. You simply aimed at the screen and shot. It was amazing. Nintendo [did this] beat everyone to the punch by releasing to the market a game that allowed unique and special ways to interface with the game through imaginitve controls a good twenty years before the motion controls of the Wii and the XBOX 360 Kinect, etc.\n\nNot all \"villains\" are truly villains. Some characters are actually on your side but you still hate anyway. One such game features a dog that jumps into bushes to scare a duck out of the brush. It is your job to kill these animals. And if you miss, man's best friend, the dog, does something rather annoying. The manual states: \"The hound comes out and laughs at you.\" So much for moral support. --Mike London",

    "description": "Resident Evil 2 is the first really big, ultrahyped blockbuster of '98, and what Capcom has pulled off is more an interactive, cinematic experience than a video game. Seriously. Picking up a few months after the events of the first game, RE2 sees the entire town of Raccoon City hit with the devastating virus that zombified only a few dozen folks in the original Resident Evil. It's up to rookie cop Leon Kennedy, and Claire Redfield, sister of one of the main RE characters, to save not only themselves but any and all survivors, to boot. The gameplay remains basically the same as before: As one of two characters, you solve puzzles and shoot monsters. The original Resident Evil featured two playable personas as well, although the differences between the two weren't incredibly significant. One could carry more items than the other could, while the other was easier to play, and they both had their own distinct storylines. In Resident Evil 2 the differences between the two are a bit more interesting. For example, Claire starts off with a lock pick, while Leon begins with a lighter, which alone changes the order in which the game's puzzles must be solved. Each character also finds different weapons along his or her quest. For instance, Claire will find a grenade launcher, however when playing as Leon, a shotgun will be in its place.",

Virtua Cop for the Saturn delivers the same great action as the arcade version. The graphics are almost flawless as they deliver pulse throbbing action sequences and nonstop excitement. One of the factors that makes this game a winner is the option that lets you choose where you lead your cop, which the game does at many points throughout the story. Virtua Cop also leaves off that irritating part of Time Crisis no hiding behind barrels or overturned cars, and wondering: \"Where the hell is my enemy going to pop up at.\" However sometimes you just wish that you could direct your cop anywhere at anytime in the game --Cloud_09",

    "description": "It's time to bow down. With new tracks, weapons, and ships, and improved graphics, Wipeout XL is one of the top second generation titles for the Playstation this quarter. Wipeout XL has six all-new tracks and two hidden bonus tracks. There are fifteen ships, seven more than the original game. Each ship's strengths and weaknesses appear right on screen: top speed, turning ability, shield level, energy level, thrust, and aerodynamics. Wipeout XL's turning has been fine tuned, making it much tighter, yielding superior control and \"road hugging.\" The weapons in the original Wipeout slowed the opponent down but yielded little satisfaction. In the sequel, it is possible to completely eliminate a weak opponent from the race. The earthquake weapon is unspeakably awesome. The graphics in Wipeout XL show the benefits of a year's efforts. The tracks are more detailed, with parrots flying through the lush vegetation of the South American track and monorails cruising along beside the hovercars. The background visuals are elaborate to the point of distraction. The weapons are visually spectacular, and seeing the light trails behind the hovercars is just plain cool. The sound effects are an improvement over those in the original, offering sonic details of everything from the laying of mines, to the explosion of a direct missile hit. The music soundtrack features a mix of techno and ambient house tracks that perfectly matches the pace of the game. The artificial intelligence has been tweaked up a few notches and will aggressively attempt to eliminate players right from the start. Wipeout XL is linkable, providing head-to-head racing action for two Playstations. Wipeout fans, this is a must buy. For those of you who have lived under a rock for the past year, get with it and reach for XL.--Tom Ham--Copyright © 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

    "description": "Gears of War 3 succeeds where other trilogy enders fail. Some people play for the online, and others play for the story, and as time goes by it seems games are focused more on the multi-player aspect while the single player seems like a second thought. I don't play online. To me, a great game comes from a story that is fun to play, and characters who are fun to be.\n\nGears of War 3 is the last game in the \"Delta Squad\" trilogy. The games lead characters have come a long way from the juiced up one liners from the first game. Gears of War 3 is more of a emotional story than the past games, and you may find yourself caring about Marcus, Dom, Cole, and Baird more than you would in any other game. They succeeded in making you care for the soldiers of Delta Squad. And that is what is missing in most games today and it was good to see that Epic Studios wrapped up the story is a mostly neat package. I say mostly because almost every question is answered in the final game. --Phillip Schneider",

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations, Super Mario Sunshine is almost entirely as good as you’d hope and expect.\nThe premise of the game is that Mario’s tropical holiday is ruined when he’s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there’s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.",

    "description": "Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control.",

    "description": "The Legend of Zelda series practically defined adventure gaming for an entire generation. Link, the hero of the adventure games, delighted millions by starring in games for each Nintendo console from the NES and Super NES to the Nintendo 64. Link brings this beloved franchise to the Nintendo GameCube in The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and he's more animated than ever.\nThe first thing you'll notice about The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker is that it looks completely different from any previous title in the franchise. Nintendo has opted to use cel-shading technology on Wind Waker; the result is that the game looks like a cartoon. Die-hard Zelda purists initially howled at this change, arguing that the game skews too young. I think it's fantastic. The cartoon animation style allows for better expression of the characters, and several of the animations--like Link trying to pick up an object that's too heavy--are so cute that you can't help but laugh a little.",

    "description": "Well first of all, I own this game because I can play on my animal crossing for the gamecube. I don't have a nes, but I can play it, so I technically own it. This game is really fun. The screen starts out giving you a choice of \"selection A, selection B\", and \"design\". This game really doesen't have a plot. It's a racing game, but it's very unique, also the fact that it's a classic NES game makes it all the better. Selection A lets you choose 5 race tracks-from easy to hard. Selection B is exactly the same. However, once you start a race in selection B, other racers will be there as well as you. I find selection B annoying because if you bump into a racer (which happens ALOT) you fall down (there are numerous ways to fall down, once you do, press the B button repeadedly to get back up on your bike). However in selection A you are all alone. I usually do selection B for a challenge. And finnaly, there's design. Design is really fun. What happens is there will be a track with no obstacles on it. Your character will be on that track, but he will not be moving and you are not racing. --Gift Card Recipient",

    "description": "Mario's Picross could be one of the last great games for classic Game Boy. Granted, puzzle games aren't for everyone, but I think this title offers a perfect blend of quickness with pure logic.\nThe premise is very simple (as with most great games): First, a blank grid is displayed, either 5x5 (very easy), 10x10 (beginners), or 15x15(standard). At the top of each column and to the left of each row is a series of numbers indicating the number and length of \"tiles\" to be chipped away. So, assuming the 15x15 grid, if a row indicates \"7 7\", seven tiles should be chipped, a pristine tile should be left in the middle, and then another seven tiles chipped. When one considers the possible combinations of sequences (both horizontal and vertical), one realises the great opportunity to exercise skills in pure logic and deduction. I'm sure this would be one of Sherlock Holmes' favourite games.",

In the game, you whack a Pokeball around a pinball machine that's constructed of Pokémon-related obstacles and structures. There are two machines, Red and Blue, and each machine has its own techiques, challenges, bonus levels, and Pokémon. Yep, the idea in the game is to capture Pokémon. How? Well, each machine has its own way of finding the creatures, but once you find it, it's all a matter of hitting it six times with your Pokeball. They'll appear in the center screen, and if you manage to catch a Pokémon, it'll sit in your built-in Pokedex. Each machine will also give you the ability to evolve captured Pokémon, since some creatures are not out in the wild. What happens when you manage to get all 150 Pokémon?",

    "description": "The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.\n\nThis game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.",

    "description": "It is a shame that Nintendo can't clone Miyamoto, the genius behind the Mario and Zelda games. He is easily Nintendo's greatest asset, and one of the most brilliant storytellers ever to work in the interactive medium. His latest effort, Star Fox 64, is a game designed in his tradition of greatness, and it's perhaps the best N64 game seen since Super Mario 64 - which is still considered by many as the best video game of all time.\nStar Fox 64, the sequel to the Super Nintendo title Star Fox, is a shooter in the truest sense. As happens in Star Fox's predecessors, you fly along and blast away your enemies while powering up your weapons. But Star Fox 64 adds quality gameplay twists that rival the game's incredible 3D graphics. These features include multiple gameplay paths (which take you through various levels depending on how well you play, including a Tomorrow Land-like city, a meteor-filled corner of space, and a post-apocalyptic battleground), a submarine and a tank level, a four-player battle mode, and the smoothest 3D flight control yet seen on a console system. Not only is the animation incredibly smooth, but every polygonal building and ship is finely detailed. The enemies are also quite varied - in fact, the final boss, Andross, even qualifies as menacingly scary (there's something terrifying about a huge ape that literally chews you up and spits you out). This game is a pleasure to look at and does the Star Wars-like storyline justice with a truly cinematic quality.",

This system of warp rooms is a great innovation; it's clear how to progress in the game, and yet you have the option of moving to a different level if you're hopelessly frustrated with one area. Best of all, you can save your game in the warp room at any time (a big improvement over the original game's horrific save system).",

It is sort of like a puzzle: the object is to capture all of the enemies into bubbles and then pop them before the bubble bursts and the enemy escapes. Once you have cleared all the enemies, you advance to the next level. You can play with one player or two, and you can always continue. There are extras that you can get within the level: letters to spell EXTEND, which will advance you to the next level and award an extra man, a shoe that makes the little dinosaurs run fast, candy which alters the type of bubbles you can blow, an umbrella which allows you to skip a few levels, a heart which freezes all of the enemies and allows the dinosaurs to hit them (even if they aren't in bubbles), and much more. I think that this game is one of the best games for NES, if not the best one. -Nicole Alger",

    "description": "Mega Man II, with huge levels (for the NES), and great graphics (again, for the NES), would establish Mega Man (Rock Man in Japan), as a commercially viable video game character who would later become the most prolific character in terms of video game releases (and by this, I mean full fledged releases, not cameos, in which Mario takes the cake). But his success is owed to this pheonomenal game. The first, although somewhat successful, did not have the commercial impact as this did. Repeating the formula of the first Mega Man with giving you multiple stages and you chosing which one you want to tackle first and adding two bosses and dropping the score you get when beating the bosses, Capcom came up with 8 great bosses and a tremendous game. A large part of the fun is figuring out the order in which to beat the bosses. This also allows you to up the difficulty level if you want an extra challenge, as each of the boss's weapons work against another specific boss. The most difficult, as I remember, was Flash Man's stage. Those beams got me all the time. But don't worry, you can clear all eight stages. And once you do, going to Dr. Wiley's castle and attempting to figure out all the complexities only add to it. Top of the line graphics, wonderful music, amazing game play, what more could you want? This has all the markings of a bona-fide classic. --Mike London",

Jumping, spinning, power-ups, that thing Sonic does when you make him jump and you press the jump button again, and last but definetly not least Super Sonic that's where the fun begins. The graphics were a noticable improvement, Sonic and Tails never looked so good. The music is well...the usual \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" tunes. Despite the lack of ideas \"Sonic the Hedgehog 3\" is still an incredibly fun game to play, even by todays standards. Definetly worth your hard earned money. --The Gamer Man",

Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to pound on.\nStarting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked), the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner, there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually found in similar titles.",

    "description": "When Tetris hit the scene, it became more than just a popular video game. It became a cultural phenomenon. Usually when a game achieves an unusual amount of success you'll have a game try to copy the formula (usually failing). Doctor Mario, on the other hand, didn't try to copy the formula put forth in Tetris. It simply put a new spin on the puzzle genre.\n\nDr. Mario perhaps some of the simplest gameplay of any game. Mario stands on the sidelines and throws pills into a jar. In the jar are different color viruses. Red, Yellow and Blue. The color of the virus doesn't matter. What matters is the colors on the pill Mario throws in. The objective is to simply match the corresponding color of the pill with the virus. In the first level, there are just a few viruses. The higher the level the more viruses are in the jar.\n\nYou don't have to begin at level one. You can choose what level you want to begin with. Even then, the game doesn't end at the maximum level you can choose. It keeps going. Much like Tetris, there's really no end to the game. --Tsanche",

    "description": "As stranded, miniature spaceperson Olimar, you must find the missing 30 parts your spaceship needs to get you back home. The parts are scattered across a forested area crowded with giant (when compared to our hero's size) animals and other hazards. Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant, all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.\nLearning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks. However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to minimize losses that makes Pikmin challenging and fun.",

But the crystals which held the horrible monster Crator inside the tower were missing, and so was Crator. Then a radio message crackled into the cockpit. It was Dr. I... \"Bomberman, Mr. Meanie has unleashed Crator and is using his powers to conquer the world! You must get the crystals back before it's too late! ",

SRC is an other \" arcade to Saturn port \" that simply put, \" ROCKS! \" It was the first racing game to ever have the ability to drive on different surfaces, IE: mud, asphalt & gravel, with the car's handling changing with each surface you're driving on. This was a BIG deal in the day, no other game came close to it in 1995. WOW! Back then I remember people crying, \" there's only three tracks and two cars \" oh boo-hoo! ( there is a fourth hidden track & a third hidden car! ) What the cry babies didn't understand was that the cars drove like real cars, and the tracks felt real because they had different friction properties in each case. --Mark B Allred",

    "description": "It seems today that most video games have an end game or some mission you are trying to accomplish. But in the early days of video games, most of them featured the same idea repeated in multiple levels of increasing difficulty with the real goal being getting the highest score possible before dying. Does that make some of these game repetitive? On the contrary, some of them are highly addictive, as Asteroids for the Atari 2600 proves.\n\nThe premise of the game is very simple - you are in a ship in space that has been surrounded by giant asteroids. You have to blast them all out of the sky before they run into your ship. Each level starts with a bunch of large asteroids. When you hit those, you get two medium size asteroids. Hitting those turns them into one small asteroid that disappears when you hit it.\n\nAs you can well imagine, those when the asteroids start multiplying, it can get chaotic quickly. While you only start with four big asteroids in the first level, every one after that starts with nine. --Mark Baker",

Now repackaged as one of PlayStation's Greatest Hits, this top-selling game takes you away on a tropical island adventure that is filled with precarious enemies and challenging levels. Our spiky-haired hero Crash needs no weapons to survive the harsh jungle. Instead, he jumps, jogs, and spins his way through numerous lush and downright fun environments. With 26 levels spanned across three tropical islands, Crash Bandicoot is sure to amuse old gamers as well as new. Crash must rescue his girlfriend, Tawna, from the evil clutches of Dr. Cortex. Along the way, he can gather fruit for extra lives, smash boxes for random prizes, and gather tokens that can be used for bonus rounds. Numerous big bosses block your path, which also includes more than a few risky jumps that require split-second timing. Crash Bandicoot's impressive graphics and strong gameplay have already won over many hard-core and casual gamers. While this PlayStation classic has already spawned two successful sequels, the original version remains a worthy purchase--particularly at the sub-$20 price. --Kasty Thomas",

    "description": "Super Mario Bros. 3 is the third game in Nintendo's long-running Super Mario series. It was released back in 1990, during the prime of the NES. It was a game that proved that \"hi-fi\" technology (like the Sega Genesis) wasn't needed to make a game great. Shigeru Miyamoto managed to utilise every inch of the NES hardware to produce what is probably the best-selling video game cartridge of all time. So enchanting and addictive is Super Mario Bros. 3, that in EGM magazine's 100th issue four years ago, it was chosen as the second best video game of all time!\nAfter failing to conquer the Mushroom Kingdom, Bowser has started creating turmoil in the Mushroom World. He has used a flying ship to travel through the seven lands of the world and transform the ruler of each land into an animal by means of a magic wand. So Mario & Luigi have not only to travel to the Dark Land where Bowser lurks, but also to transform the kings back to normal. For the first time ever, the game makes use of a \"land map\" in which levels are spread out, so that it's easier to follow the progress you make. --Madhura de Silva",

You could almost say that it's just like the driving portion of Die Hard Trilogy except the cops chase you. Perhaps the best comparison would be to say Driver is just like Destruction Derby in a city with cops, traffic, and mission-based gameplay. After all, the same company makes both games. But that wouldn't be fair either, because while Driver resembles a lot of games, it's really quite unique, and fun. You play the role of Tanner, a former racecar driver turned policeman. Thanks to your past driving experience, you are selected to go undercover as a wheelman for hire to investigate the Castaldi family, the underworld's most dangerous organization. Before you can go through the game's story mode you must complete an extreme driving test that is really hard. You are asked to complete various driving maneuvers, such as a 360, a reverse 180, a slalom course, and other advanced driving techniques that will greatly help you later in the game. Once you complete this test, you can start taking jobs. Just about all the various jobs consist of getting somewhere to pick someone or something up, or dropping someone or something off before the time limit expires. Some of the most enjoyable missions, however, are the ones in which you must ram a fleeing vehicle until it's disabled. To help you find your way through the vast cities, there is an onscreen map that shows you the location of your objective point and the streets that you can use to get there. This map is extremely helpful and makes the game more about driving and less about navigating your way through the cities - a problem that Grand Theft Auto suffered from.",

Obviously the first is the amazing storyline that not only picks up right where the first installment left off, but it develops the story a considerable amount with regard to the history of the gods (especially Zeus), the titans, and most excitingly, the past great war between both (I'll give nothing away but suffice it to say that the curious might want to grab a decent Greek Mythology handbook to look up alot of the names associated with the new faces).",

    "description": "Mario Kart 64, one of the first games released for the Nintendo 64 platform, is an updated translation of the very popular Super Mario Kart for the Super NES (SNES). And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling have been left out of this release.\nStill, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, and Mario Kart 64 offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks. Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels. Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck speeds, if only for a moment.\n\nThe multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen. --Eric Twelker",

Shedding the two-dimensional graphics and limited sound capabilities of its predecessors, Final Fantasy VII features lush 3-D graphics, beautifully animated \"movie\" sequences, and soundtrack-quality music. Coupled with the game's intricate storyline, endearing characters, and immense yet highly imaginative world, these new advancements make for a quite an engrossing experience.\nThe story of Final Fantasy VII centers around a solider named Cloud Strife, who joins forces with Avalanche, a group of resistance fighters, to take down an evil mega-corporation known as Shinra. (The fate of the world hangs in the balance, of course.) Truly epic in scope, this four-disc game requires a considerable amount of time to complete---this reviewer gladly gave up over 80 hours of his life to finish it. But it's definitely a rewarding adventure that every PlayStation owner should consider undertaking, especially since it's now one of the low-priced \"Greatest Hits\" titles. --Joe Hon",

What greed.\n\nThe gameplay is pure one-on-one fighting. You can choose from a number of fighters (I choose Sub-Zero), and then you battle onward from fighter to fighter. Eventually, you'll get to the Endurance rounds, which let you face against the defeated fighters, but you must face 2 under one go. That is what makes the game stand out.\n\nThe graphics are as great and faithful to the original arcade version's.\nI can say the same for the sound and music quality. --Ryan Sil",

    "description": "One might wonder why a two-dimensional game for a defunct, decade-old system is still getting rave reviews. Simply put, Guardian Heroes' 2D gameplay still exceeds the quality of most present day games where style is a higher priority than substance.\n\nBrought forth by Treasure, the same group responsible for classics like Gunstar Heroes, Silhouette Mirage, and Alien Soldier, Guardian Heroes allows up to four players to wreak havoc on an oppressive empire led by a tyrannical wizard. For the quest mode, players could choose to play as a headstrong knight, a female defensive mage, a young offensive mage, or a lithe ninja. Each character has its own specialties and weaknesses, which players will have to balance out to get far in the game. --Lazio Gutierrez",

    "description": "When the Nintendo Entertainment System was released in late 1985 to much critical acclaim, Kid Icarus was one of the first games to grace everyone's homes. Your hero, Pit, is responsible for taking down the evil Medusa. But in order to do so, he must progress through 4 worlds: the Underworld, the Overworld, the Skyworld, and the Palace In The Sky. Each world is divided into 4 sections (with the exception of the Palace In The Sky).\n\nAs you begin the game in the vertical-scrolling Underworld, Pit will need to explore every open door with the many surprises that await him. There's the Enemy Room, the Treasure Room (you can earn a credit card if you shoot all of the treasure bags that don't contain the Reaper), the Training Room (this allows Pit to acquire 3 special weapons: the Fire Arrow, the Holly Bow, and the duo Protective Crystals), 2 different Shopkeeper's Rooms (you can purchase the Hammer, Water Of Life, Barrel, Glass Of Wine, or Angel Wing), the God's Room (he'll upgrade your Arrow if you've killed enough enemies), and the Hot Springs room (which can refill Pit's Life Meter). Furthermore, the more points that you rack up at the end of every level, the sooner that Pit's life bar will expand (to a maximum of 5).\n-- jdealy999",

Based on the arcade classic of the same name, Soul Calibur lets you choose to represent one of 10 fighters in a series of battles against your peers. If you can successfully defeat all of your opponents, you will then face the fiendish Inferno in a final showdown that will determine the fate of the world. Each of the game's warriors is armed with a different deadly weapon--sword, ax, stave, nunchaku, you name it--and an assortment of special moves all tailored to that specific weapon. The warriors include men, women, and creatures from all over the globe and from various mythologies. Each is brought to life with amazing motion-capture animation, which results in incredibly lifelike and realistic duels. If you own a Dreamcast or are thinking of buying one, do yourself a favor and add Soul Calibur to your collection. --Mike Ryan",

    "description": "Combining the road rage-inspired dark fantasies of Mad Max with a twist of campy black humor, Twisted Metal III is a worthy addition to the emerging car combat genre. Though the game is sure to be a hit with newcomers of the series, fans of the previous Twisted Metal games will find that TM III doesn't quite fire on all cylinders.\nThe story runs somewhere between Mortal Kombat and your wildest dreams of demolition derbies. But the paper-thin plot doesn't matter: you have a rad car and aren't afraid to use it. Whether you choose to control the monster truck driven by the little old lady, Mr. Grimm's motorcycle o' death, or what is quite possibly the coolest ice-cream truck ever, you'll speed and skid around the asphalt-covered levels, grabbing power-ups and blowing up your opponents with a wide array of vehicle-mounted weaponry.\n\nIn a game like this, several things are key: physics, control, and level design. Twisted Metal III departs from the previous games in the franchise. The levels are smaller and the physics and controls conspire to make the vehicles handle oddly. The bottom line: car-smashing fun that doesn't quite live up to the glories of the prequels. --John Cocking",
