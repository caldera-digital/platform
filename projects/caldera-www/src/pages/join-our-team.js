        <h2>Join the Collective</h2>
        <p>
          We’re group of people with a particular set of skills that come
          together to craft great outcomes. All of our employees are
          contractors, and many folks have their own freelance gigs on the side.
          This creates a unique dynamic – giving both personal goals and shared
          goals some time in the limelight. We work to bring you opportunities
          to engage with challenging projects and to open you up to a network of
          talented people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our projects consist of anything and everything within the digital
          landscape. Our tasks are constantly evolving, so we’re always looking
          for coders, copywriters, visual designers, musicians, social media
          gurus, user experience experts, photographers, bloggers, chefs,
          videographers and everything in-between (SEO bots do your thang). If
          you have a skill that can be tailored to the internet - we want to
          hear from you.
        </p>

        <h2>Mentorship Program</h2>
        <p>
          Calling all college students, recent graduates, and people looking to
          change their careers! Our mentorship program gives you the chance to
          work as a contractor and try your hand in the freelance landscape.
          There’s no job description for this role because it’s dependent on YOU
          and what YOU want to learn. This is paid, 100% remote and has flexible
          hours. Pretty sweet, right?
